I’m passionate about learning new skills, and improving upon those I already have.  Currently, I am learning aspnet core, dotnet core, python and machine learning in my free time.  I attended the M-Cubed data-science conference in 2018 to further my exposure to ML.


I’m also interested in DevOps/CI/CD, and so I’ve spent some time looking into Docker / Kubernetes (minikube) / Jenkins / Ansible.  Whilst this isn’t my area of expertise, I am interested in learning more, and plan on spending more time in this domain.


I try to keep up-to-date by viewing the [Thoughtworks’ Tech-Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar), and generally following [Martin Fowler](https://www.thoughtworks.com/profiles/martin-fowler) and reading his books; such as Continuous Delivery, and Accelerate.  I’m also making my way through the new C# in Depth 4th Edition by the legendary [Jon Skeet](https://stackoverflow.com/users/22656/jon-skeet), and have CLR via C# on my backlog.  I also use tech blog aggregators, such as [The Morning Brew, by Chris Alcock](http://blog.cwa.me.uk).


I enjoy playing foosball, board games, and rocket league, I also enjoy climbing, running, yoga, and spending time with my family.
