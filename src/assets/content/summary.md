A Senior Software Engineer with over 10 years’  hands-on experience developing reliable, high-performing, n-tier applications.  Having mostly used the Microsoft technology stack in the aerospace sector, but also has hands on experience with Java.

I’m keen to keep learning new tech, such as Angular and dotnet-core, and to continuously improve upon my existing skill-set.

I’m open-minded and willing to be led and learn from others, whilst also able to mentor and pass on my hard-won knowledge.
